# Color-image
Covert satellite image into RGB format for that used random image to implement color model to get intensity value ranging from 0 to 255.
Each color component is typically represented by an 8-bit value, ranging from 0 to 255, where 0 represents no intensity and 255 represents maximum intensity. The combination of these three color channels allows for the creation of millions of different colors, making RGB a popular color model for digital imaging and displays.
